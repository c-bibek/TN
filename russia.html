Kathmandu - Director of Russian Cultural Centre Dr. Vladimir Novioc emphasised the need for more people-to-people exchange between the citizens of Russia and Nepal, and not just official visits of political leaders, while addressing a press meet at the Centre located in Kamaladi on Friday.
<br>
“A centre representing Nepal is missing in Russia,” he said. Keeping this in view, and to mark the 30th anniversary of Russian Cultural Center in Nepal, said Novoic, Nepal Pavilion Company, an event management group, is coordinating Russian Cultural Exchange Festival 2009 in the valley.
<br>
General Secretary of NRN, Russia, Dr. Badri KC said that people in Russia are interested in Nepali culture, but a platform to showcase its was still missing in the country. “Therefore, a Nepal centre -- a la the Russian Culture Center in Kathmandu -- will soon be established in Russia.” The ‘Nepal House’ will be established in Kaluga region of Russia, a commercial project where Nepalis will be able to showcase Nepali craft and open authentic Nepal restaurants.”
