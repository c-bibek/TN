<H3>Sri Lankan Prez to visit lumbini</H3>
<br>
<p>
Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who cut short his visit to Nepal this spring after an attack on Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan, is expected to arrive Nepal once more this month to complete his itinerary, according to IANS.<br>

Rajapaksa, who had arrived Kathmandu on a three-day visit in March, cut short his trip by a day after gunmen attacked Sri Lankan cricket team bus in Lahore. Rajapaksa immediately flew to Colombo before visiting Lumbini, the birth place of Lord Buddha.<br>

However, he intends to visit Lumbini during his second visit to Nepal, later this month. Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist nation, has pledged to construct a monastery complex in Lumbini and help promote religious tourism.
